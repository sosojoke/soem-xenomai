/** \file
 * \brief
 * EtherCAT RAW socket driver.
 *
 * Low level interface functions to send and receive EtherCAT packets.
 * EtherCAT has the property that packets are only send by the master,
 * and the send packets allways return in the receive buffer.
 * There can be multiple packets "on the wire" before they return.
 * To combine the received packets with the original send packets a buffer
 * system is installed. The identifier is put in the index item of the
 * EtherCAT header. The index is stored and compared when a frame is recieved.
 * If there is a match the packet can be combined with the transmit packet
 * and returned to the higher level function.
 *
 * The socket layer can exhibit a reversal in the packet order (rare).
 * If the Tx order is A-B-C the return order could be A-C-B. The indexed buffer
 * will reorder the packets automatically.
 *
 * The "redundant" option will configure two sockets and two NIC interfaces.
 * Slaves are connected to both interfaces, one on the IN port and one on the
 * OUT port. Packets are send via both interfaces. Any one of the connections
 * (also an interconnect) can be removed and the slaves are still serviced with
 * packets. The software layer will detect the possible failure modes and
 * compensate. If needed the packets from interface A are resend through interface B.
 * This layer if fully transparent for the higher layers.
